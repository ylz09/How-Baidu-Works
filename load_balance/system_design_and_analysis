Problems:
There are many timeout due to the overloaded BC which means Basic Control of Basic Search nodes. 
There are several different type of BC and BS, while history BS is largest BS and it's most time consuming one.
So the goal of this project is to reduce the number of returned docs by history BS, which is originally 600 docs.
The current bandwidth is about 70Mb/s. 

System analysis:
1st, history BS return 600 docs to BC, causing BC received results more than 1000 docs. 
2nd, BC only 1000 docs to AC, so this a waster of bandwith.
3rd, the percentage of queries whose number of results between (300, 600] is around 1.5%;
4th, BC didn't hit cache and inquery BS is around 17%
5th, BC cache rate is more than 50%, the probablity of results more than 1000 docs is 27%
Conclusion: 
	1. there are too many docs returned by BS to BC
	2. we need reduce the number and at the same time guarentee the BC received 1000 docs.

From the logs of 4 history BCï¼Œ we learned that:
	1. cache hit rates are all 63%
	2. miss cache & return more than 1000 docs:
		machie1: 23.8%
		machie2: 23.9%
		machie3: 23.9%
		machie4: 23.9%
	3. by reducing the returned result, we enhanced the BC cache rate
	4. the queries of BS decrease from 10,000,000 to 8,000,000
		Before: 10889034 10921454 11482483 10762879
		After:  8299255 8245994 8239223 8242547
	5. queries return more than 1000 docs:
		Before: 2008179 2006561 2004525 2006685
		After:  1978905 1973440 1975528 1971650 
	6. we know the rate of queries of 1000+ is not reduce.
	7. by doing this experiment, we reduce the BS return number from 600 to 200

After the the bandwidth of the 4 machine:
grep bond0 band.data | awk 'BEGIN{sum=0}{sum+=$6+$7}END{sum/=NR;print sum}' 
10.77.104.142 47261
10.77.104.143 45363.7
10.77.104.144 54905.5
10.77.104.145 49998.9
And the timeout problem is solved!
